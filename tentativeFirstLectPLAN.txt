Plan:
*Linear Transformations -- basic LinAlg
det transform matrix = scale factor
no code - make exercise
Perspective -- show zooming -- NOT SAME AS UNDISTORTING

^good exercise
(10-20 minutes)
*Direct Linear Transformation --
HEAVY LinAlg, light code
^challenge: find balance
Homogenous coors, system
UNDISTORTING

(15 minutes)
^If math is simplified:
**Homographic feature matching

Affine Transform
Homography
